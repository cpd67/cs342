Vision statement for CS-342 project
-----------------------------------

I was thinking of modeling a restaurant, where the database would store information about food and beverages and the relations between them.
There would be appetizers, main dishes, and desserts as well as a variety of beverages (soda, alcholic beverages, shakes, smoothies, etc...).
Potential stakeholders include customers who would like to see a menu of the different dishes that the restaurant offers, and management to determine
stock quantities of ingriedents. The corresponding views would be different for the two sets of stakeholders, as one would be a menu and the other 
would be an inventory list.
