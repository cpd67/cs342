Vision statement for CS-342 project
-----------------------------------

A potential idea would be to model information pertaining to car manufacturers. Information about cars and car parts would be stored. 
Information about cars would include their body type (SUV, sedan, and so forth), make, model, year, engine type, and more. 
Parts information would include what part of the car it is, and the information would vary depending on what part it is (engine, transmission, crank shaft, etc...). 
I would also include the costs for each part and car, and there would be relations between certain parts and certain cars (for example, engine type. A specific make of a car may need a different engine type than another make). 
I would also include the quantity for each part and car, to see how many are left in stock at the manufacturer.

Potential stakeholders would be the management of the manufacturer to do inventory on stock and to check which car parts they need to buy (should they run out of some). 
Car dealerships would also be potential stakeholders, as they could ask for a list of cars to buy so they could sell them at their location. 
Mechanics could also be another set of stakeholders, as they could order parts from the manufacturer for their business.
