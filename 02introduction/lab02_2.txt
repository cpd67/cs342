Exercise 2.2:

a). Yes, you could. Here is the constraint that I would specify:

	ALTER TABLE Movie
		ADD CONSTRAINT checkScoreAndVotes;
		CHECK (score IS NULL or votes > 1000);			

b). Yes. If the constraints change frequently, then it would be good to have them in a separate place 
	than the table definition it modifies so that you wouldn't have to keep making changes to your definition
	whenever your constraints change. 
	Keeping the constraints inside of the definition means that you have to go inside of the definition
	and modify it everywhere that it is used, which could lead to bugs and other problems if done incorrectly.
	In sum, it would be good for maintenance of the database.
