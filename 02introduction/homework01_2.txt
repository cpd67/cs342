Exercise 2.13: 

Choose a database application with which you are familiar. Design a schema and show a sample database for that application, 
using the notation of Figures 1.2 and 2.1. What types of additional information and constraints would you like to represent 
in the schema? Think of several users of your database, and design a view for each. 

  ANSWER:
  
  College(COLLEGE_ID, collegeName, schoolYear)
  Course(COURSE_ID, sectionID, creditHours)
  Section(SECTION_ID, courseID, startTime, endTime, profFirstName, profLastName, meetingDays)
  Student(LOGIN_ID, firstName, lastName, email, password) 
  Schedule(SCHEDULE_ID, scheduleName, studentID)
  
  NOTES: 
  + The 'schoolYear' field in the College table is the year that you are attending a college (e.g. Summer 2017, Fall 2018...)
  + The 'password' value would have to be encrypted for security reasons.

  Additional information that I would like to represent is the relation between courses, such as when a course has a lab (a 
  corequisite). Also, I would like to represent the relation between the schoolYear field in a College record and a Course record (as a 
  course may only be offered during a specific year, like certain electives). Also, where the room number is for each Course record (the 
  location where the actual course is taught). 
  Constraints would be that the studentID for a Schedule record cannot be NULL (if a schedule is saved, it must be associated with a 
  student's name), and the schoolYear cannot be NULL for a College record (a college has to start at a specified year in order to select 
  courses that are availible in that year). Also, a password would have to be a certain number of characters (to add security), and 
  start and end times would be represented in the form of XX:XXAM or XX:XXPM (and there would have to be a range of valid times that a 
  course starts and ends; e.g. a course shouldn't start at 01:00AM, or at 11:00PM and shouldn't end at a time when another course 
  starts). A similar constraint is for the 'meetingDays' field of the Section table; they should be of the form "M/W/F", "M/T/Th/F", 
  "T/Th", or singular days (as in classes that meet only once a week, for example) and shouldn't include Saturday or Sunday. 
  
  Views: 
  Students - the current view that SlatePermutate has (where a student can input the 'Class ID' and see the information for that
              specific course). 
  Administrator - a view where someone with the proper credentials can edit the application, in case a course is no longer availible or 
                  offered or the times for it changed (start or end). (You would have to make sure that someone has the proper 
                  credentials in order to make changes to the database; a student shouldn't be able to make changes, for example, to a 
                  Course record).
