Exercise 2.13: Choose a database application with which you are familiar. Design a schema and show a sample database for that 
                application, using the notation of Figures 1.2 and 2.1. What types of additional information and constraints 
                would you like to represent in the schema? Think of several users of your database, and design a view for each.
