Exercise 1.14: Consider Figure 1.2.
a). If the name of the 'CS' (Computer Science) Department changes to 'CSSE' (Computer Science and Software Engineering) Department
    and the corresponding prefix for the course number also changes, identify the columns in the database that would need to be 
    updated.
    
    ANSWER: The columns in the following tables would have to be updated: 
    STUDENT: Major
    COURSE: Course_number, Department
    SECTION: Course_number
    PREREQUISITE: Course_number, Prerequisite_number
 
 b). Can you restructure the columns in the COURSE, SECTION, and PREREQUISITE tables so that only one column will need to be updated?

     ANSWER: Yes, you can. By taking away the course prefix in the Course_number columns for the SECTION, COURSE, and PREREQUISITE 
             tables, as well as from the Prerequisite_column in the PREREQUISITE table, then the only column that would need to be changed
             is the Department column in the COURSE table. (You would have to use the prefix in that column in order to distinguish two
             courses with the same Course_number value, should that ever occur). 
 (Follow-up question from homework): Yes, you would do the same restructuring as in my answer to 1.14b in order to change the values
                                       of one field.
