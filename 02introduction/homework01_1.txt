Exercise 1.14: Consider Figure 1.2.
  a). If the name of the 'CS' (Computer Science) Department changes to 'CSSE' (Computer Science and Software Engineering) Department
      and the corresponding prefix for the course number also changes, identify the columns in the database that would need to be 
      updated.
      
  b). Can you restructure the columns in the COURSE, SECTION, and PREREQUISITE tables so that only one column will need to be updated?
