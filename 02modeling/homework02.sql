-- Exercise 5.14:

-- The foreign keys are specified in the schema implementation below. They are: 
-- + customerNumber in the ORDER table, as that references a record in the CUSTOMER table with the associated customerNumber as its ID. 
-- + itemNumber in the ORDER_ITEM table, as that references a record in the ITEM table with the associated itemNumber as its ID.
-- + orderNumber in the SHIPMENT table,	as that references a record in the ORDER table with the associated orderNumber as its ID.
-- + warehouseNumber in the SHIPMENT table,	as that references a record in the WAREHOUSE table with the associated warehouseNumber as its ID.

-- Other constraints that I can think of for the database are implemented below as well. 
-- They include:
-- + checking the unitPrice field of a record in the ITEM table (we should not have items with negative prices)
-- + checking the orderAmount field of a record in the ORDER table (we should not have orders with negative amounts)
-- + checking the quantity field of a record in the ORDER_ITEM table (we should not have order items with negative quantities).

--First, drop any implemented tables before creating them.
DROP TABLE ORDER_ITEM;
DROP TABLE ITEMS;
DROP TABLE SHIPMENT;
DROP TABLE ORDERS;
DROP TABLE WAREHOUSE;
DROP TABLE CUSTOMER;

-- WAREHOUSE records
INSERT INTO WAREHOUSE VALUES (1, 'Grand Rapids');
