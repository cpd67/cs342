-- Exercise 5.14:

-- The foreign keys are specified in the schema implementation below. They are: 
-- + customerNumber in the ORDER table, as that references a record in the CUSTOMER table with the associated customerNumber as its ID. 
-- + itemNumber in the ORDER_ITEM table, as that references a record in the ITEM table with the associated itemNumber as its ID.
-- + orderNumber in the SHIPMENT table,	as that references a record in the ORDER table with the associated orderNumber as its ID.
-- + warehouseNumber in the SHIPMENT table,	as that references a record in the WAREHOUSE table with the associated warehouseNumber as its ID.

-- Other constraints that I can think of for the database are implemented below as well. 
-- They include:
-- + checking the unitPrice field of a record in the ITEM table (we should not have items with negative prices)
-- + checking the orderAmount field of a record in the ORDER table (we should not have orders with negative amounts)
-- + checking the quantity field of a record in the ORDER_ITEM table (we should not have order items with negative quantities).

--First, drop any implemented tables before creating them.
DROP TABLE ORDER_ITEM;
DROP TABLE ITEMS;
DROP TABLE SHIPMENT;
DROP TABLE ORDERS;
DROP TABLE WAREHOUSE;
DROP TABLE CUSTOMER;

-- Schema implementation
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER (
	customerID integer,

	-- If a customer no longer exists in a database, delete all records that contain 
	-- orders made by that customer because that customer no longer exists in the database. 
	FOREIGN KEY(customerNumber) REFERENCES CUSTOMER(customerID) ON DELETE CASCADE,
	CHECK (orderAmount >= 0.0)
	);

CREATE TABLE ITEMS (
	itemID integer,

	);

CREATE TABLE ORDER_ITEM (
	orderID integer, 
	itemNumber integer,
	quantity integer,
	PRIMARY KEY(orderID),
	-- If an item no longer exists in a database, set the ID to null
	-- because at that point a record in the ORDER_ITEM is no longer 
	-- storing a valid value which is an ID of a record in the ITEM table. 
	FOREIGN KEY(itemNumber) REFERENCES ITEMS(itemID) ON DELETE SET NULL,
	CHECK (quantity >= 0)
	);

CREATE TABLE WAREHOUSE (
	warehouseID integer, 
	city varchar(20),
	PRIMARY KEY(warehouseID)
	);
	
CREATE TABLE SHIPMENT (
	shipmentID integer,
	orderNumber integer, 
	warehouseNumber integer, 
	shipDate date,
	PRIMARY KEY(shipmentID),
	-- If you do not know the order number for a shipment, you don't know what to ship and so 
	-- should also delete any records that require that order number because you do not know what exactly
	-- to ship, which could cause problems.
	FOREIGN KEY(orderNumber) REFERENCES ORDERS(orderID) ON DELETE CASCADE,
	-- If you don't know the warehouse, you don't know where to ship the order to and so 
	-- shouldn't have records that have references to that warehouse that doesn't exist anymore
	-- because you wouldn't know exactly where to ship an order to.
	FOREIGN KEY(warehouseNumber) REFERENCES WAREHOUSE(warehouseID) ON DELETE CASCADE

-- Create 3-5 sample records
-- CUSTOMER records

INSERT INTO CUSTOMER VALUES (4, 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'Grand Haven');
INSERT INTO CUSTOMER VALUES (5, 'Jerry', 'Eaton', 'Ada');

-- ORDER records
INSERT INTO ORDERS VALUES (1, DATE '2011-03-11', 1, 30.0);
INSERT INTO ORDERS VALUES (2, DATE '2012-01-21', 2, 50.0);
INSERT INTO ORDERS VALUES (3, DATE '2013-04-01', 3, 6.00);
INSERT INTO ORDERS VALUES (4, DATE '2012-06-11', 2, 40.0);

INSERT INTO ORDER_ITEM VALUES (5, 5, 1);

-- WAREHOUSE records
INSERT INTO WAREHOUSE VALUES (1, 'Grand Rapids');
INSERT INTO WAREHOUSE VALUES (2, 'San Diego');
INSERT INTO WAREHOUSE VALUES (3, 'Lebanon');

-- SHIPMENT records
INSERT INTO SHIPMENT VALUES (1, 1, 1, DATE '2011-03-09');
INSERT INTO SHIPMENT VALUES (2, 2, 2, DATE '2012-01-19');

-- Exercise 5.20.a:

-- I cannot think of any natural choices of keys that could be used to identify the 
-- student record, apart from having a composite primary key that includes two or more
-- pieces of the student's information (address and home phone number, for example). 
-- However, even this is insufficient to uniquely identify a student record.
-- Siblings who both attended the university at the same time would have the same address
-- and home phone number, thereby circumventing the uniqueness constraint for primary keys 
-- as both records for those siblings would have the same composite primary key. 
-- You could make ALL pieces of information for a student the primary key, 
-- but it would just be easier to use a surrogate key to identify each student 
-- instead of how many pieces of information for each student. 
-- Therefore, surrogate keys are an easy way to uniquely identify records 
-- without having to have composite primary keys for each student record. 

-- Exercise 5.20.c:

-- Advantages: Finer grained control over keys (you can ensure that the uniqueness constraint 
-- 				is enforced much more easily, as you only have to assign one number to each 
-- 				record), you only have to keep track of one piece of information for 
-- 				the primary key (instead of having a composite primary key in place of 
-- 				using a number).
-- Disadvantages: If you forget which generated keys have been assigned to records 
-- 					then you could run the risk of accidentally reassigning an already 
-- 					assigned key (easier to lose track of which keys are unique),
-- 					they are artificial and so do not provide an accurate, natural, and unique way 
-- 					to identify the 'miniworld' that the database is supposed to be representing 
--					(i.e. some aspect of the real world).
--

-- Follow-up question for Exercise 5.20:
-- I would recommend that CIT continue using surrogate student ID numbers. The reason is 
-- because it is a much easier way to uniquely identify a student when compared to 
-- having to figure out a natural key (which may end up being a composite primary key 
-- that may cause difficulty in enforcing the uniqueness constraint).

-- 3.a:
SELECT orderDate, orderAmount FROM ORDERS, CUSTOMER 
	WHERE customerNumber=customerID AND (customerFirstName || ' ' || customerLastName)='Billy Bob' ORDER BY orderDate;

--Help in using the DISTINCT claus was obtained from:

SELECT DISTINCT customerID FROM CUSTOMER, ORDERS WHERE customerID=customerNumber;
SELECT customerID FROM CUSTOMER;
SELECT customerNumber FROM ORDERS;

-- 3.c:
SELECT customerID, customerFirstName, customerLastName FROM CUSTOMER, ORDERS, ITEMS, ORDER_ITEM 
	WHERE (customerID=ORDERS.customerNumber) AND (ORDERS.orderID=ORDER_ITEM.orderID) AND (ORDER_ITEM.itemNumber=ITEMS.itemID) AND (ITEMS.itemName='Hat');
