1. Chapter 5 (focus primarily on Sections 5.1–5.2)

a. Who invented the relational data model? When and where did they do their work?
  Ted Codd invented the relational data model. He worked at IBM in the 1970s. 

b. Explain the following terms:
i. relation

ii. attribute

iii. domain
  A domain is a set of atomic values ('atomic' means that each value in the domain is indivisible as far as the formal relational model is concerned). A common way of specifying a domain is to specify a data type from which the data values forming the domain are drawn (and it is also useful to specify a name for the domain to help in interpreting its values). 

iv. n-tuple

v. NULL value

vi. primary, foreign, candidate and super keys

vii. referenced and referencing records

c. Are tuples in a relation ordered? How about attribute values in a tuple? Explain why or why not.

d. Can attributes have multiple values in a single n-tuple? Why or why not?

2. Chapter 6 (focus primarily on Sections 6.1–6.2 & 6.4) — Make sure that you know how to:

a. Create tables with specified constraints, including primary/foreign key, not-null, domain and value-check constraints.

b. Use the DML commands: INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE.

c. Distinguish the ON DELETE actions: SET NULL, CASCADE.
