1. Read Chapter 3.

a). Compare and contrast the database and the software design processes. Are agile modeling practices applicable to database design as well?

b). Explain the following terms: entities, relationships (including cardinality and participation constraints), attributes (simple, composite, multi-valued and derived).

c). Explain weak entities and identifying relationships.

d). Model a person-household database (from class 2) using an ERD.

e). Skim the material in Section 3.8 on UML diagrams; we wonâ€™t use it here but we have addressed it in CS 262 and will review it in unit 11.

2). Read Chapter 9.

a). Map the ERD model from above to a relational database model.

b). Explain how to map from a UML model to a relational database model. We will address this issue more carefully in a later unit (on object-relational mapping).
